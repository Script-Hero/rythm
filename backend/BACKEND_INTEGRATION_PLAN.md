AlgoTrade Beta1 → Beta2 Migration Plan

    Executive Summary

    Beta1 is a monolithic Flask application with significant technical debt - bloated handlers, duplicated functionality, and tight coupling. Beta2 provides a modern microservices architecture with Redis sliding windows, Kafka
    event streaming, and proper separation of concerns. This plan maps every Beta1 component to its appropriate Beta2 microservice with optimization opportunities.

    Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Migration

    1.1 Database Migration

    Source: backend/database/ (SQLite)
    Target: Beta2 PostgreSQL schema

    Tasks:
    - Migrate strategy data from strategies.db to PostgreSQL
    - Transform session data to new forward testing schema
    - Preserve user data and historical results
    - Create migration scripts for data integrity

    Key Files to Migrate:
    - database/database.py:68-120 → shared/models/strategy_models.py
    - database/session_handler.py → Forward Testing Service database layer

    1.2 Strategy Engine Migration

    Source: compilation/parser.py (node registry + compilation)
    Target: Strategy Service + shared strategy engine

    Critical Components:
    - Node registry (parser.py:24-32) → shared/strategy_engine/nodes.py
    - Strategy compilation (parser.py:compile_strategy()) → strategy-service/app/services.py
    - 20+ node types → Enhanced with proper validation

    Optimization: Cache compiled strategies in Redis vs current memory-only caching

    1.3 Market Data Infrastructure

    Source: data/ directory (multiple providers)
    Target: Market Data Service with Redis sliding windows

    Key Migrations:
    - data_manager.py:15-50 → market-data-service/app/data_providers.py
    - coinbase_client.py → Enhanced WebSocket provider
    - Cache system (cache/market_data/) → Redis streams implementation

    Phase 2: Service Decomposition

    2.1 API Gateway Creation

    Source: server.py + core/server_handlers.py (5000+ lines)
    Target: API Gateway Service

    Handler Migrations:
    - StrategyHandlers (server_handlers.py:54-200) → API Gateway strategy routes
    - MarketDataHandlers → Route to Market Data Service
    - BacktestHandlers → Route to Backtesting Service
    - ForwardTestingHandlers → Route to Forward Testing Service

    Benefits:
    - JWT authentication centralization
    - Rate limiting per user
    - Request routing vs monolithic handlers

    2.2 Forward Testing Service

    Source: services/ directory (8 separate service classes)
    Target: Consolidated Forward Testing Service

    Service Consolidation:
    services/forward_test_service_manager.py:19-50     → main.py (service orchestration)
    services/session_state_manager.py                 → services.py (session management)
    services/strategy_execution_service.py            → Background task system
    services/session_metrics_calculator.py            → Real-time performance calculation
    services/realtime_data_processor.py               → Redis sliding window integration
    services/session_event_publisher.py               → Kafka event publishing
    services/session_validator.py + session_data_transformer.py → Request validation layer

    Optimization: Replace in-memory session state with Redis-backed state management

    2.3 Backtesting Service

    Source: backtesting/ directory
    Target: Dedicated Backtesting Service

    Migrations:
    - backtest.py:run_backtest() → Distributed backtesting engine
    - backtest_metrics.py → Advanced analytics service
    - Historical data caching → S3 integration for large datasets

    Performance Improvements:
    - Job queue system vs synchronous processing
    - Parallel backtesting vs single-threaded
    - Results storage in S3 vs local files

    2.4 Strategy Service Enhancement

    Source: Strategy compilation + template management
    Target: Enhanced Strategy Service

    Core Migrations:
    - templates/manager.py → Template management API
    - Node validation logic → Comprehensive validation engine
    - Strategy caching → Redis-based caching

    Phase 3: Advanced Features

    3.1 Notification Service

    Source: WebSocket handling in server.py
    Target: Dedicated Notification Service

    Migration Points:
    - WebSocketHandlers class → WebSocket connection management
    - Event publishing → Kafka-based event streaming
    - Real-time updates → Session-specific routing

    3.2 Analytics Service

    Source: Scattered analytics calculations
    Target: Centralized Analytics Service

    Consolidation:
    - Performance metrics → Real-time calculation engine
    - Risk analysis → Advanced risk management
    - Portfolio analytics → Multi-session aggregation

    Phase 4: Optimization Opportunities

    4.1 Data Access Optimization

    Problem: Beta1 requires each strategy to manage data independently
    Solution: Redis sliding windows provide instant data access

    Before (Beta1):
    # Each strategy manages its own data
    strategy.get_historical_data(symbol, period)  # Expensive database/API calls

    After (Beta2):
    # Instant access to sliding windows
    GET /api/market/symbols/BTCUSD/latest?limit=100  # Sub-millisecond response

    4.2 Event-Driven Architecture

    Problem: Beta1 uses synchronous processing with tight coupling
    Solution: Kafka event streaming for loose coupling

    Event Flow Migration:
    Beta1: Strategy → Direct Database Write → WebSocket Broadcast
    Beta2: Strategy → Kafka Event → Multiple Consumers → Targeted Updates

    4.3 Scalability Improvements

    Problem: Beta1 monolith cannot scale individual components
    Solution: Independent service scaling

    Scaling Targets:
    - Market Data Service: Scale for WebSocket connections
    - Forward Testing Service: Scale for concurrent sessions
    - Strategy Service: Scale for compilation workload
